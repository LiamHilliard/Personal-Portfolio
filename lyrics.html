        Sippin' on promethazine
        I'm sippin' on promethazine
        I can't put down the cup
        Can't put down the cup (what time it is?)
        I can't put down the cup
        Can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup

        Sippin' on promethazine
        With lean, I fell in love

        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup

        Sippin' on promethazine
        With lean, I fell in love

        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup

        Got kicked out of middle school 'cause of Mr. Garnica
        They sent me to East Locust with all of the drug addicts
        That's when I started smoking weed and picking up bad habits
        And I love all my niggas, but I promise I'm not a faggot, aye
        And these bitch niggas gon' hate me 'cause I ran it up and got a Patek Philippe
        That's your main bitch toppin' me, and I busted on her, now I'm going to sleep
        Let a nigga try to run down, .357 leave 'em dead in the street
        First day out of the hospital, and I'm back to making bitches cum on my meat
        Sippin' on promethazine
        I'm sippin' on promethazine

        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup

        Sippin' on promethazine
        With lean, I fell in love

        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup

        Sippin' on promethazine
        With lean, I fell in love

        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
        I can't put down the cup
